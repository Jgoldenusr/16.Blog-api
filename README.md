## About the project

This website was made for the "Blog API" challenge on TheOdinProject.com.

This project is meant to showcase all of the fullstack skills learned so far.

I also took advantage of this project to start getting a solid grasp of TailwindCSS and Vite.

This was my last project before getting my first real life job.
